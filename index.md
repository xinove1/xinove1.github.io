Hi, I'm Thomi, programmer, coffee fanatic, and interested in OS's and games. 
<br>
<br>
I'm mostly **self taught**, but started refining my skills at **École 42**, where I was able to learn **C**, one of my current programming passions.
<br>
At the moment, I’m focused on game development, making **games from scratch**. However, I also aspire to work with **tools and operational systems**.
<br>
<br>
Filtered coffee supremacy btw, dvorak AND qwerty btw, nvim & emacs.
